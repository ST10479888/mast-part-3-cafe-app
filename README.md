The app shown in the screenshots is called *Christoffels Cutlery*, a restaurant-themed mobile application that allows users to browse, manage, and add dishes to a digital menu. The app has a sleek black and yellow design that gives it a modern and elegant look, matching the restaurant theme perfectly.

The *first screen* is the *welcome screen, which greets users with the message *“Welcome to Christoffels Cutlery by Christoffel” followed by “Experience the best Cuisine.” This page sets the tone for the app by creating a warm and inviting introduction. There is a bright yellow *Enter* button at the center of the screen, which takes the user to the main menu page of the app.

The *second screen* is the *main menu display, where users can view the list of available dishes offered by the restaurant. Each dish is displayed with a large image, the name of the dish in bold yellow text, and a short description below it. For example, the “Buffalo wings” item includes an image of the wings, a description about the spicy fried chicken tossed in hot sauce and butter, and details such as the price and category. The “Beef burger and chips” item is displayed in the same way, showing a burger image and description. Each dish card also includes a **Remove* button that allows the user to delete an item, and at the bottom of the screen, there is a yellow *Add New Item* button for adding more dishes.

The *third screen* is the *Add a New Dish page, which lets users input all the details of a new menu item. It includes text fields for entering the **Item Name, **Description, **Category, **Price, **Ingredients, and an **Image URL* for the dish’s picture. Once all the information is entered, the user can press the yellow *Save Item* button to add it to the restaurant’s menu. There is also a *Back* button that allows users to return to the previous screen without saving.

Overall, *Christoffels Cutlery* is a user-friendly app designed to make managing a restaurant’s menu simple and visually appealing. It allows restaurant owners or staff to add, view, and remove dishes easily while maintaining a stylish and consistent design throughout.
